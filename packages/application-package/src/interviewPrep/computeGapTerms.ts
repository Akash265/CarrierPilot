 * so short terms like "Go" are not hidden by "Google") -- in the text of any profile evidence entry,
 * formatted exactly as buildEvidenceIndex formats it ("context: text"), so a term found here can never
 * also appear in a p: evidence snapshot. job_requirements has no order column, so terms are sorted
 * (term, then id, by plain code-unit comparison for stability across environments) for a stable result.
 * Returns EVERY missing required term (no cap, D100): callers that feed the model slice the first
 * MAX_GAP_TERMS themselves, while the likely-question gap check and the stored snapshot use all of them.
 * Only skill, tool and certification terms of at most MAX_GAP_TERM_WORDS words are candidates (D104):
 * "other"-typed and longer, phrase-shaped requirements ("Production data pipeline building experience")
 * are descriptive and almost never contained verbatim in profile text, so they would be false gaps. The
 * cost: such a requirement is never treated as a gap, even when the profile really lacks it.
 * Known limitation (design §9, D92): "Postgres" in the profile does not cover "PostgreSQL" in the job.
