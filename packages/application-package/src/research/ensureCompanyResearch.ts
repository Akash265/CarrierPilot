/**
 * Per-company research cache (design doc §4, D74).
 * - Reuse: an existing row is returned as-is unless forceRefresh, or its status is "failed" (a failed
 *   attempt is retried automatically; "no_results" is a genuine answer and is reused).
 * - The paid, slow research call runs OUTSIDE any transaction; only the write is transactional.
 * - Write: upsert on (user_id, company_key) + delete-and-reinsert facts, in one short transaction, so
 *   concurrent first-time calls end with exactly one row and one fact set (last writer wins).
 * - "A failure must never replace good research" is enforced ATOMICALLY AT WRITE TIME, not from the
 *   stale `existing` read taken before the 30-90s research call: when the new result is "failed", the
 *   upsert's `onConflictDoUpdate` only fires if the row's CURRENT status (as of the write, inside the
 *   same transaction) is also "failed" (`setWhere`). If that guard blocks the update (a concurrent
 *   caller already committed non-failed research), `returning()` comes back empty and we re-read
 *   whatever is now stored: a plain call returns it; a forceRefresh throws
 *   CompanyResearchRefreshFailedError instead of overwriting it. A first-ever write for a company has no
 *   conflict at all, so it always succeeds even when it is a "failed" result.
