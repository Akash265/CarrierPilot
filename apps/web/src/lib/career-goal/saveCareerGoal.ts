 * Confirming a career goal never edits an existing career_goal_constraints
 * row (D23) -- it writes a brand-new one for the pending `career_goals` row
 * created at parse time (D24), then activates that goal and deactivates
 * whichever one was previously active. Older confirmed rows are left
 * untouched, preserving full version history.
 *
 * Only a goal that parsed successfully and is not yet confirmed can be
 * confirmed. The user's goals are locked for the whole transaction
 * (lockUserCareerGoals) so simultaneous confirms serialize: two different goals
 * cannot both end up active, and the second confirm of the same goal sees it
 * already confirmed and gets a CareerGoalStateError rather than tripping the
 * unique constraint on career_goal_constraints.career_goal_id.
