# HTTP API

Every route lives in `apps/web/src/app/api/**/route.ts`. Request bodies are validated with Zod in the route (or the
package it calls); the exact schema is the reference, this page is the map.

## Conventions

- **Single user.** There are no accounts ([D1](../DECISIONS.md)); every query runs as `DEFAULT_USER_ID` under Postgres row-level security ([D2](../DECISIONS.md)).
- **Request gate** (`apps/web/src/proxy.ts`, [D177](../DECISIONS.md)) runs before every route:
  - `421 { error: "Unknown host" }` unless `Host` is `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]` or in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
  - `403 { error: "Cross-site request blocked" }` for a `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` from another origin.
  - When `APP_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set: `401 { error: "Access token required" }` without the `/unlock` cookie or `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (exempt: `/api/unlock`, `/api/health`).
- **Errors** are `{ error: string }` with a 4xx status: `400` for an invalid body or query, `404` for an unknown (or malformed) id, `409` for a state conflict.
- **Unexpected errors** never leak: `500 { error: "Something went wrong (request <id>)…", requestId }` with an `x-request-id` header; the server logs `request_failed` with the same id ([D169](../DECISIONS.md)).
- **AI budget**: AI routes answer `429 { error, code: "ai_budget_exceeded" }` once the monthly ceiling is reached ([D155](../DECISIONS.md)).
- **Rate limits** ([D178](../DECISIONS.md)): routes marked *ai* (`RATE_LIMIT_AI_PER_MINUTE`, default 10) or *jobs* (`RATE_LIMIT_JOBS_PER_MINUTE`, default 20) are limited per route per minute; over the limit they answer `429 { error, retryAfterSeconds }` with `Retry-After`. `/api/unlock` allows 5 attempts a minute and `/api/health` 60 a minute.
