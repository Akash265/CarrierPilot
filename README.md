# AI Career Intelligence & Application Platform

Personal AI career operating system: natural-language career goal → job
discovery/ranking → factual, ATS-oriented application generation →
human-approved submission → outcome tracking.

See `docs/architecture.md` for system design and `DECISIONS.md` for the
rationale behind each architectural choice.

## Quick Start (local, no paid services required)

1. Copy env template: `cp .env.example .env`. Two DB URLs are required, per
   the two-role Postgres convention (see `DECISIONS.md` D12):
   - `DATABASE_URL` — the least-privilege `career_intel_app` role, used by
     app runtime code so RLS is actually enforced.
   - `MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL` — the superuser `career_intel` role, used only
     by `drizzle-kit generate`/`migrate` (schema DDL needs RLS-bypass).

   Leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `VOYAGE_API_KEY` as placeholders until you
   reach a phase that actually calls them — not needed for Phase 0/1.
2. Start infrastructure: `cd infra && docker compose up -d` (Postgres +
   pgvector, Redis, MinIO).
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install` (from repo root).
4. Run database migrations: `pnpm --filter @ai-career/db db:migrate`.
5. Start the web app: `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm --filter web dev` to run just the
   Next.js app).
6. Verify: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health` should return
   `{"status":"ok","checks":{"database":true,"redis":true}}`.
7. Start the ingestion worker (needed for scheduled and "Run now" fetches):
   `pnpm --filter @ai-career/job-ingestion start`. It is a plain Node process
   (there is no Dockerfile or compose service for it yet). Enabling a source
   on the Sources page makes the worker's reconcile tick (within about a
   minute) start that source's first fetch automatically; after that the
   source is fetched every `INGEST_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 360). Run
   exactly one worker process; two would race on the same source (an advisory
   lock per source is future work).
8. Start the matching worker (needed for "Find Matches" runs):
   `pnpm --filter @ai-career/matching-worker start`. Also a plain Node
   process with no scheduler -- matching only ever runs when the `/matches`
   page's "Find Matches" button enqueues it. Run exactly one worker process
   (concurrency is 1 either way).
9. Start the maintenance worker (needed for the Phase 9 retention sweep to
   run on its own): `pnpm --filter @ai-career/maintenance-worker start`, or
   in Docker with `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml --profile workers
   up -d --build` (opt-in profile; plain `up -d` still starts only the infra;
   the container reads the repo's `.env` and reaches Postgres/Redis/MinIO by
   service name). It upserts a daily BullMQ scheduler on boot (the first run
   fires immediately) and then deletes generated
   documents for applications that have been in a terminal status
   (accepted/declined/rejected/withdrawn/no_response) for `RETENTION_DAYS`
   (default 30; `0` disables it). To run the sweep once by hand -- e.g. right
   after backdating a `terminal_at` for testing -- use
   `pnpm retention:run` instead of starting the worker; it runs the exact
   same code path a single time and exits. Inside Docker the equivalent is
   `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml --profile workers run --rm
   maintenance-worker node_modules/.bin/tsx src/runOnce.ts`.

After adding new migrations, migrate the *test* database once before running
the whole suite:
`MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL=postgres://career_intel:career_intel@localhost:5432/career_intel_test pnpm --filter @ai-career/db db:migrate`.
(Suites that start together on an empty database can collide creating the same
enum; CI does this step first for the same reason, see `DECISIONS.md` D38.)

## End-to-end smoke test (optional)

`services/job-ingestion/e2e/smoke.ts` drives the real web app, queue and worker
against a fake ATS server (see its header comment). It expects a **fresh
database** (fixed board `fakeco`, absolute job counts), so point it at a scratch
database, never the dev database. Create one with the extensions and app-role
grants that `infra/postgres/init.sql` gives the dev database, then migrate it:

```bash
docker exec infra-postgres-1 psql -U career_intel -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE career_intel_e2e"
docker exec infra-postgres-1 psql -U career_intel -d career_intel_e2e \
  -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector; CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;" \
  -c "GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE career_intel_e2e TO career_intel_app; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO career_intel_app; GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO career_intel_app; GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO career_intel_app; ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO career_intel_app; ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO career_intel_app;"
MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL=postgres://career_intel:career_intel@localhost:5432/career_intel_e2e pnpm --filter @ai-career/db db:migrate
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://career_intel_app:career_intel_app@localhost:5432/career_intel_e2e
```

(`docker exec infra-postgres-1` assumes the compose project name `infra`;
check `docker ps` if yours differs.) Then, with that `DATABASE_URL` exported,
run these in four terminals from the repo root (a variable set before a
`dotenv`-wrapped script wins over the value in `.env`):

```bash
pnpm --filter @ai-career/job-ingestion e2e:fake-ats
GREENHOUSE_API_BASE=http://localhost:4011 LEVER_API_BASE=http://localhost:4011 pnpm --filter @ai-career/job-ingestion start
pnpm --filter web build && pnpm --filter web exec dotenv -e ../../.env -- next start -p 3100
WEB_URL=http://localhost:3100 pnpm --filter @ai-career/job-ingestion e2e:smoke
```

Every line should print `PASS`, ending with `All checks passed.`. Afterwards
stop the three processes, delete the `bull:job-ingestion*` keys it left in Redis
(delete exact keys; do not flush), and drop the scratch database.

## Status

Foundation phase (Phase 0/1) complete: monorepo, Docker Compose
infrastructure, validated env config, single-user RLS pattern, Next.js
shell, health-check route, CI.

Phase 2 (Candidate Profile) complete: resume upload (PDF/DOCX/LaTeX) to
MinIO, AI-assisted structured extraction with mandatory user review,
normalized candidate-profile schema, and profile_facts generation +
Voyage embeddings. Visit /profile after `pnpm dev` to use it.

Phase 3 (Career Goal Intelligence) complete: natural-language Career Goal
Statement parsing with mandatory user review, deterministic parsing of the
minimum and preferred salary, and versioned career_goal_constraints —
replacing the Phase 2 rigid-preference fields it superseded. After
`pnpm dev`, the home page links to both steps (/profile, /career-goal).

Phase 4 (Job Intelligence) complete: Greenhouse, Lever and CSV/JSON sources
behind a consent gate, a BullMQ ingestion worker, deterministic normalization
(salary, work mode, experience, sponsorship, posted date), three-tier
deduplication and a Sources page and read-only Jobs browser.

Phase 5 (Hybrid Matching) complete: deterministic eligibility filtering,
hybrid retrieval blending a JS-side lexical keyword hit-rate with pgvector
semantic similarity, nine weighted match factors with an explainable
per-factor breakdown, and AI
match reasoning (top-ranked jobs only, evidence-grounded, never given raw
job text) via a separate matching-worker. The home page links every step
(/profile, /career-goal, /sources, /jobs, /matches). Not built yet: an
`industry` field (industry matching is a company-name heuristic), and
auto-triggered recomputes.

Phase 6 (ATS Resume Optimization) complete: structured job-requirement
extraction cached per job (`job_requirements`), an evidence-bound resume
optimizer whose selected/reworded bullets must each trace back to a real
row in the candidate's own profile data (a deterministic guard, not the
model's self-report, is the sole authority), and a deterministic ATS
scorecard (`ats_evaluations`) covering keyword coverage, semantic
similarity, factual consistency and action-verb/readability heuristics.
Runs synchronously inside the API route -- no new worker. Available from
the "Optimize Resume" button on a job's match detail page
(`/matches/[jobId]`). `job_requirements` deliberately does not yet feed
Phase 5's matching factors (see docs/architecture.md §13).

Phase 7a (Company Research & Hiring Manager Pitch) complete: on an eligible
match, "Generate Pitch" researches the company with Anthropic web search
(only API-cited facts are kept; no personal data is sent), then writes a
three-bullet pitch whose every bullet must cite real evidence. Pitches are
versioned and editable. Requires `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_RESEARCH` in `.env`
(see `.env.example`).

**Upgrading an existing checkout:** `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_RESEARCH` is required
by `loadEnv` — without it, every web API route returns a 500 (the app itself
starts), and both workers and `db:migrate` fail to start. Add
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL_RESEARCH=claude-sonnet-5` to `.env`.

Phase 7b (Document Export) complete: on a match page, the selected optimized
resume or pitch version downloads as PDF or DOCX (single-column, ATS-readable,
Unicode font embedded). Files are stored in MinIO and listed under "Documents";
export is refused if your profile changed since the optimization or a generated
pitch still has an unsupported bullet.

Phase 7c (Cover Letter & Interview Preparation) complete: on an eligible match,
"Generate Cover Letter" writes an optional 4–5 paragraph letter whose
opening, company and evidence paragraphs must each cite real evidence
(versioned, editable, PDF/DOCX export), and "Generate Interview Prep" builds a
read-only, exportable pack of likely questions with answer outlines, honest
framings for required skills missing from your profile (the gap list is
computed deterministically, not by the model), company talking points and
questions to ask. Existing checkouts: run `pnpm --filter @ai-career/db
db:migrate` to add the two new tables.

Phase 9 (Application Tracker) complete: "Mark as applied" on any match
page (or "Add external application" on `/applications`) records which
resume/pitch/cover-letter versions you actually sent, a one-time snapshot of
the match/ATS scores at that moment, and puts the job on a `/applications`
tracker with a status timeline, follow-up dates, and a log of notes,
recruiter contact and interview events. An applied job leaves the ranked
`/matches` feed ("already applied") but its generated documents stay
viewable on `/matches/[jobId]` until retention deletes them; the
application's detail page lists the versions sent and links there.
Browser automation (Phase 8) is deferred, so every application is recorded
by hand rather than by an automation session. Existing checkouts: run
`pnpm --filter @ai-career/db db:migrate` to add the two new tables, and see
below to run the retention sweep.
